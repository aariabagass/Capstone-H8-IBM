## Optimizing Investment and Tourism Infrastructure in Bali
## 📝Project Overview

### Objective
To identify regions in Bali with high tourism potential that are currently under-recognized, uncover tourism potential gaps across different areas, determine priority regencies for investment, and evaluate tourist destinations with low ratings.

### Highlighted Issues
- Concentration of tourism in certain regencies (over-tourism)
- Inequality in tourism infrastructure across regions
- Low quality and popularity of certain tourism categories
